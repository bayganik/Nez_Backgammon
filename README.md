# Nez ECS Backgammon Example

This is a Backgammon game in progress. NEZ is a 2D Framework specifically uses C# and Monogame.

ECS is used to allow for separation of concern when coding. For example, I choose to update my components using a separate "System".  
However, You will find most examples of NEZ to be using updates inside "Components".  I don't like that.  NEZ is flexible enough to allow you to choose which way to go !!

## Sample Screen

I've added a "Tag" property to all Buttons in Nez.  Please make that addition to your Nez project, recompile.  See the image below.
